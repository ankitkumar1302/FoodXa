## üìã Implementation Details

### Navigation System
The app implements a custom navigation system with two main flows:
1. **Authentication flow** (login/signup)
2. **Main app flow** with tabbed navigation for:
   - Home feed
   - Search/Explore
   - Shopping cart
   - User profile

```kotlin
// Navigation handling in MainActivity
when (currentScreen) {
    "auth" -> {
        // Show login or signup screens
    }
    "main" -> {
        // Show main app content with bottom navigation
    }
}
```

### UI Components
FoodXa uses custom composable components for consistent design:

- **Food Cards**: Display food items with images, ratings, and prices
- **Category Pills**: Horizontally scrollable category selectors
- **Custom Text Fields**: Styled input fields for user data
- **Bottom Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with animation

### Data Structure
The app uses clean data models for representing different entities:

```kotlin
data class FoodItem(
    val name: String,
    val price: Double,
    val rating: Float,
    val imageUrl: String,
    val reviews: Int
)

data class Category(
    val name: String,
    val icon: ImageVector
)
```

### Styling Approach
FoodXa uses a consistent styling approach with:

- A dark color scheme with orange accent (`0xFFF97316`)
